    <h1>Connex Date Selection</h1>
    <p>Designing an Easier Way to Compare Dates</p>
    <p>Our goal was to design a UI for comparing data across different date ranges. Comparing data from one period to another can offer some deep insights, and while this functionality was available in some parts of the experience, it wasn’t yet a global feature.</p>

    <p>Before we started design, we researched existing JavaScript libraries that we could use and extend to fit our needs. We always have a long list of backlog features so finding a solution we could build out quickly was very important. That said, we wanted to thoroughly understand exactly what we were adding to our codebase.</p>
    <p>Knowing the capabilities of the chosen library, we could then design an interface and extend the core functionality to meet our needs. After some sketching and wireframing it was time to start designing in our pattern library. Designing with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and some sample JSON data, we were able to complete front-end development and obsess over design in parallel.</p>
    <p>Design iterations and interviews with users proved to be indispensable. What information does the user need when making a selection? What is the selection order? How do later steps respond when initial steps are modified? These were some of the questions we discussed that helped us make more informed design decisions.</p>

    <p>There’s a lot of logic packed into that 400px by 500px panel. The presets, custom date inputs and the calendar are all tightly coupled; changing one will update all three. Turning on compare dates is now inside the main panel, making it easier to enable. When a user compares data to the same time last year, the actual dates are displayed as help text before any data is loaded. Updating the initial date range will update the compare dates.</p>
    <p>Along the way there are a few supplemental design touches that really add to the experience. First, when selecting dates on the calendar, a helpful tooltip appears to show the number of days that are being selected. Second, if a date range extends beyond two months, the calendar splits to allow any selection while still only taking up the screen space of two calendar months.</p>

    <p>By the time the back-end and mid-tier developers were finished with the API, we had a fully designed piece of UI ready for integration. The process of comparing dates is now more intuitive and quicker to access with the addition of the calendar. Combining all the date settings into one panel eliminated an extra page load and designing this feature in the browser made the process that much easier.</p>
