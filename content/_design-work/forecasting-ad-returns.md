  <h1>Forecasting digital advertising returns</h1>
  <p>Marketing agencies often use data to drive and measure the success of their campaigns. But manually copying reports from different sources into one spreadsheet is error-prone and time consuming; time that is better spent actually using that information in a more meaningful way.</p>
  <p>As part of the product team at Rise Interactive, we designed a platform that pulled data from multiple sources, forecasted future returns and created new, transparent methods of reporting.</p>

  <h2>Understanding the data</h2>
  <p>Designing a data-heavy application required a deep understanding of the data that went into it. Google AdWords certifications and collaborations with data scientists led to a better grasp of digital advertising intricacies and how to identify the signal from the noise.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="type-column revealblock">
  <h2>Designing with data</h2>
  <p>We designed with code &#8212; using the same JavaScript libraries our developers used to visualize data: <a href="https://c3js.org/" target="_blank">C3</a>, <a href="https://d3js.org/" target="_blank">D3</a> and <a href="https://www.datatables.net/" target="_blank">Datatables</a>. Our design-focused front-end environment eventually grew to become our design system. Everything from buttons to templates were documented and nested using <a href="https://patternlab.io/" target="_blank">Pattern Lab</a>.</p>

  <h2>Audience</h2>
  <p>Our audience contained two major groups: analysts within the organization and clients outside of the company. We regularly met with both to understand how each would use the same product-and there were some distinct differences. Because of the unique needs of each group, user flows were customized to better deliver the most appropriate content to the right person.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="type-column revealblock">
  <h2>Viewing information</h2>
  <p>We designed new ways to compare data, like moving budgets across tactics and platforms. If a sponsored ad on Amazon wasn't performing as well as the equivalent paid search ad on Google, analysts could shift spending to the latter and generate a report for the client.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="type-column revealblock">
  <h2>Future spend</h2>
  <p>Data quickly became more substantive and reliable because of this hyper-focused reporting. Analysts began writing algorithms to find patterns that had generated higher returns. Our team then integrated those algorithms back into the application. From a single interface, analysts could adjust a series of variables to programmatically forecast returns for any campaign.</p>

  <h2>Results</h2>
  <p>Comparing and forecasting data at every level provided a view of information that wasn't available on any other platform. Features like automated dashboards, cross-department reporting, cross-category reporting, location segmentation and custom date ranges further propelled our digital product as one of the company's main differentiators.</p>
