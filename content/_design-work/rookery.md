    <h1>Updating Chicago's oldest skyscraper</h1>
    <p>The Rookery is the oldest standing high-rise in Chicago. It was completed by Burnham & Root in 1888 and is considered one of their masterpiece buildings.</p>

  <div class="skinny">
    <p>While I was a Senior Designer at Torque, the building’s management company asked us to update The Rookery for a new renovation project. About every ten years, a portion of the building is either renovated or restored. This particular renovation included ultra-modern business suites.</p>

  <div class="skinny">
    <p>The challenge was to take something very ornate and make it modern. Given the historical significance of the building, we really wanted to do that tastefully.</p>

    <p>Interior photos of the building were flipped and rotated together, which created these beautiful abstract shapes. It still gave a sense of what it felt like to walk through the building. The vast lobby, the winding staircases, it's all there but it looks more like what your memory may recall during a dream rather than a direct representation.</p>

    <p>The bright headlines represent the modern addition. A brand new addition to the space. It's impactful and bold — like the actual space itself.</p>
