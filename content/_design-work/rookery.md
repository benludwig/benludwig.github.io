    <h1>Updating Chicago's oldest skyscraper</h1>
    <p>The Rookery is the oldest standing high-rise in Chicago. It was completed by Burnham & Root in 1888 and is considered one of their masterpiece buildings.</p>

  <div class="skinny">
    <p>When I was a designer at Torque, the buildingâ€™s management company asked us to give it a modern update for a new renovation project.</p>
  </div>

<div class="skinny">
  <p>How do you take something so ornate and make it look modern? How do you still respect the craftsmanship and detail of the building while doing that?</p>
</div>

  <div class="skinny">
    <p>We rotated and flipped images of the interior, transforming the space into dense, flowing abstract shapes. To contrast these patterns with legible headlines, a bright, thick typeface covered each design. Each message was an homage to the original creators of the building.</p>
