    <h1>Updating Chicago's oldest skyscraper</h1>
    <p>The Rookery is the oldest standing high-rise in Chicago. It was completed by Burnham & Root in 1888 and is considered one of their masterpiece buildings.</p>

  <div class="skinny">
    <p>While I was a designer at Torque, the building’s management company asked us to give The Rookery a modern update for a new renovation project. The design direction should be flexible enough to extend to different touchpoints — web, social and print.</p>

  <div class="skinny">
    <p>Considering the historical quality of the building, our challenge was to take something very ornate and make it modern. We wanted to respect the original craftsmanship and detail but give it a unique twist.</p>

    <p>We rotated and flipped images of the interior, transforming the space into dense, flowing abstract shapes. To contrast these patterns with legible headlines, a bright, thick typeface covered each design. Each message was an homage to the original creators of the building.</p>
