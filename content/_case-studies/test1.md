<h1>Guiding a company's digital transformation</h1>
<p class="italic">How I implemented a design system during feature development and a company-wide rebranding.</p>
<p>Cox is the largest private telecommunications company in America with over 6 million users across 18 states. In addition to providing residential services like home internet and cable, the company also offers home security monitoring and on-demand content.</p>

<p>When I joined FCB as an Associate Creative Director, Cox was planning a brand update that required us to //////</p>

  <h2>The Customer Experience</h2>
  <p>The new brand embodies the idea of connection and bringing connection to life in human ways that engage and inspire. But what does this actually mean when it comes to the user experience? It was our job to define specifically what needed to change. And the new driving principles affected every aspect of the product — it was much more than a new set of colors.</p>

  <p>I traveled Design Studio’s offices in San Francisco to understand how this new brand could be translated into a digital product experience. While I was there, I put together design comps and prototypes to review in-person with the designers that created the new brand. When I returned to Chicago, our team had a head start on the official brand standards release, giving us more time to design and prepare for the brand rollout.</p>

  <h3>Tone</h3>
  <p>The brand is grounded, approachable, engaged, optimistic and dependable. Effectively communicating the personality of the new brand meant updating every touchpoint — from headlines to success messages and product descriptions.</p>

  <h3>Interface</h3>
  <p>Designing a responsive digital product with thousands of pages required a new way of thinking about layouts. It meant anticipating future changes to the interface that would be outside of our control. By visually wrapping and separating each section of a page into its own container, layouts have the freedom to move and adapt.</p>

  <h3>Photography</h3>
  <p>The new brand photography is focused on capturing moments of real connection and it’s an important part of how the brand promise and values are expressed. In order to effectively communicate this concept, we produced multiple photoshoots for both lifestyle scenes and product photography.</p>

  <h3>The Customer Journey</h3>
  <p>We identified a series of high-traffic customer journeys as context for the new brand. Not everyone starts at the homepage. And the experience doesn’t end on the website — a brand experience regularly expands to confirmation emails and text notifications.</p>


  <h2>DesignOps</h2>
  <p>To deliver a better product and decrease turnaround time, I implemented a new way for designers to work. With so many design products available, choosing the right combination all depends on the team and the client. Does everyone on the team know how to code? How does the client want to review our work?</p>

  <h3>Sketch + Abstract</h3>
  <p>Photoshop is great for editing photos. Illustrator is made for illustration. Sketch is for designing interfaces. While it doesn’t have all the prototyping power of Framer, the barrier to entry is very low: most designers and marketers can comfortably navigate the interface. When paired with Abstract, countless hours of digging through file variations are saved, allowing designers to get back to actually designing.</p>

  <h3>Atomic Design</h3>
  <p>A now ubiquitous term in the world of websites and apps, we tailored this concept to our client’s needs. Starting with context, we designed an entire library of repeatable elements that can be nested — from buttons all the way to full page templates.</p>

  <h3>Design System Manager</h3>
  <p>After building our design system in Sketch and Abstract, we migrated our design assets to InVision’s Design System Manager so multiple teams and vendors could have access everything relating to the brand in a centralized location. It now serves as their main design repository and asset management tool.</p>

  <h2>Prototyping</h2>
  <p>I also explored a number of prototyping methods when it was appropriate and necessary to describe design intent during feature development. The time it took to put some of these together was significantly less than writing extensive documentation and scheduling review meetings.</p>

  <h2>User Testing</h2>
  <p>Each feature had special considerations depending on the type of user. We called these “conditions.” If a particular user can be identified as a current customer of Cox, that’s a single condition. Conditions were used to guide our design decisions so we could serve the best content to each type of visitor. User testing was essential when designing particularly complex condition sets.</p>

  <h2>Features</h2>
  <p>During phase one, we designed over 50 new features in parallel with the design system and the new brand.</p>

  <h2>Results</h2>
  <p>The same quarter we released the first ten features, Cox set a company sales record. More specifically, online sales accounted for more total transactions than ever before. There were fewer drop offs and net gains increased across all regions. While multiple teams contributed to the company’s overall sales, the return on investment of our design efforts were attributed directly to website performance.</p>
