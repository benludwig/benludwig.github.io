  <h1>Helping fans send messages to friends</h1>
          <p>When I was an audio engineer, I recorded actors, athletes and musicians to create customizable voice messages.</p>
          <h2>&quot;We just immediately knew the sensibility was right for our audience.&quot;</h2>

          <p>Excerpts from a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/19/arts/television/19bald.html" target="_blank">New York Times article</a> describing our campaign for 30 Rock and the technology behind it:</p>

          <p>&quot;Tens of thousands of fans of the NBC show 30 Rock have had the unusual experience over the last week of picking up their phones to hear the voice of Alec Baldwin addressing them by name and wishing them a happy holiday.</p>

          <p>While the messages are obviously recorded, Mr. Baldwin can also be heard relating details about the recipient, like the person’s job and hobbies, as well as complimenting his or her physique. The promotion, using the fledgling technology of a company called Varitalk, is being mounted by the NBC Universal Television Studio, which produces 30 Rock.</p>

          <p>Those who have received the messages, which sound so seamless, have surely been left with a more pressing question: How do they do it?</p>

          <p>People who try to send such a message quickly discover that it is like the old, fill-in-the-blank children’s game of Mad Libs. During a session in a Manhattan recording studio that lasted just a half hour, Mr. Baldwin recorded about 500 first names from which the sender may choose.</p>

          <p>Mr. Baldwin also recorded the names of all the states (so that the message makes reference to where the listener is sitting) as well as entries for drop-down menus that give the sender choices for pinpointing the recipient’s job, interests and physical traits. Then a computer synthesizes all this information for a greeting.&quot;</p>
