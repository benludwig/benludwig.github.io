  If you look closely, you’ll start to notice similar-looking trucks driving to and from big event centers in Las Vegas. Those trucks carry microphones, speakers, cables and all the equipment for setting up a stage and tearing it down. Every year there are - events within the -- sq miles of the Las Vegas strip. The performers change&mdash;-, -, and - have all had a tour date or a residency there&mdash;but the system of organizing, delivering and returning equipment had remained the same.
  </p>
  <p>
  That system involved paper invoices, phone calls and inventory data scattered across multiple databases. For the veteran sound engineers that ran the warehouse, this system, overall, worked just fine. Through decades of experience, they could tell you&mdash;with surprising accuracy&mdash;equipment on the shelf versus at an event.

  The system did, however, become fractured whenever the business needed to make a change. For instance, opening smaller, satellite warehouses inside event centers. The idea was to make it easier to grab last-minute items but it also made it harder to manage multiple facilities.
